RAET is written in python.

RAET communications is centered on a communications Stack object.
There are currently two types of RAET Stacks. A RoadStack provides communication between
IP hosts via UDP sockets and a LaneStack provides communication between processes on the
same host via Unix Domain Sockets (UXD) on unix or mail slots on windows.

Although a RoadStack has a flexible set of configuration parameters,
it tries to use intelligent defaults where ever possible.

The following python snippet shows how to create a RoadStack.

.. code-block:: python

    import raet
    alpha = raet.road.stacking.RoadStack()
    
    
This will create a stack with an autogenerated unique name and the default
host address which is listening on any local IP interface and port 7530.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> alpha.ha
       ('0.0.0.0', 7530)
    
    
I we want to assign the name or a different host address  at creation time 
we can do it as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import raet
    alpha = raet.road.stacking.RoadStack(name='alpha', ha = ('0.0.0.0', 7531))
    
.. code-block:: bash

    >>> alpha.name
        u'alpha'

    >>> alpha.ha
        ('0.0.0.0', 7530)  
    
    
    

On OS X:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install raet
